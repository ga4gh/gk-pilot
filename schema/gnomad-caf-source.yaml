            description: >-
              All samples are homozygous alternate for the variant.

          lowComplexityRegion:
            description: >-
              This flag indicates the variant is found in a low complexity region. These regions were identified
              with the symmetric DUST algorithm at a score threshold of 30.

          lowConfidenceLossOfFunctionError:
            description: >-
              Low confidence in predicted Loss of Function (pLoF), where variant is determined by LOFTEE
              to be unlikely loss of function for a transcript.
            type: boolean
          lossOfFunctionWarning:
            description: >-

          noncodingTranscriptError:
            description: >-
              Marked in a putative loss of function category by VEP (essential splice, stop-gained, or frameshift)
              but appears on a non-protein-coding transcript.

          heterozygousSkewedAlleleCount:
            description: >-
              The count of individuals called as heterozygous for this variant with a skewed allele balance,
              indicating some of these individuals may be miscalled homozygous alternative allele.
