        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

A total of 124 patients had measurable disease and were evaluated for response by independent central review. Complete response was seen in four patients and partial response in 42 patients, for an objective response rate of 37.1% (95% CI, 28.6 to 46.2). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.8 (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2) months and 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.0 to could not be evaluated), respectively.",

        "description": "Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control.

BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

    "description": "This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 22 patients harbored KRAS G12A, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Three patients had partial response, 12 had stable disease, and seven progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=18), cetuximab monotherapy (n=1), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=2), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 18 weeks (1-34 weeks), median OS was 35 weeks (1-143 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-5). Median age was 62 years old (22-77) and there were 11 males and 11 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.",

        "description": "Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Of 17 patients with BRAF V600E melanoma, 4 achieved partial response, 5 experienced stable disease lasting longer than 16 weeks, and 8 experienced disease progression (including 2 with prior vemurafenib treatment). One of the partial responders had a concomitant EGFR mutation, and two of the stable disease patients had other concomitant mutations (in RET or MET). The median days on treatment was 113 (18-366) for BRAF V600E melanoma patients and 107 (17-323) for BRAF V600 wildtype patients (n=23). Patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma experienced similar response rates (24% vs 20%) and rates of metabolic response measured by decrease in FDG uptake assessed by FDG-PET (86% vs 75%) compared to non-BRAF mutant patients. Patients with melanoma, either BRAF wt or V600E, experienced significant decreases in Ki67 expression by day 15 of MEK inhibitor treatment (P<0.02).

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

        "description": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.\n\nThe VHL gene product encodes pVHL, which binds to elongin C, elongin B, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example, under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits (HIF\u03b1) binds pVHL targets HIF\u03b1 for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1\u03b1 is not hydroxylated, pVHL does not bind, and HIF1\u03b1 subunits accumulate. HIF1\u03b1 forms heterodimers with HIF1\u03b2 and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1\u03b1 subunits accumulate, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease.\n\nPathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression (i.e., deletions, frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1\u03b1, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 (no predisposition to pheochromocytoma).  Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma. \n\nAcquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors (i.e., clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas.

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

One patient was biopsied twice following crizotinib progression and once pre-treatment. This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).",

Two patients had partial response, three had stable disease, and two progressed, resulting in a response rate of 2/7 and a clinical benefit rate of 5/7 according to author criteria. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1), and cetuximab monotherapy (n=1). Median PFS was 34 weeks (17-48 weeks), median OS was 46 weeks (27-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 59 years old (53-74), and there were 6 females and one male.

BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib.

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

However, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic (von M\u00e4ssenhausen et. al.).\nMutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common, but has been described in glioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma (Rand et. al., Jones et. al., Agelopoulos et. al.).",

KRAS PIK3CA and PTEN were tested for mutation; PIK3CA H1047R was the only variant noted in the primary tumors of four patients (Patient Ids: 7, 42, 52, 64; Table S1) and the metastatic tumor of one patient (11; Table S1), who experienced disease progression following treatment. It was also noted in the primary tumors of 3 patients (25, 48, 88; Table S1) who experienced stable disease following treatment.This response was consistent with observations made of the larger cohort, where patients with tumors harboring any PIK3CA mutation had significantly shorter progression free survival and decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtPIK3CA tumors. However, one patient (38, Table S1) had PIK3CA H1047R as the only noted variant, but experienced partial response.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR.

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The authors conclude that this finding is consistent with the work of others suggesting that PDGFRA D842V is an imatinib resistant variant in GIST.",

Mutations in the 842 region of PDGFRA have been often found to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib.",

Post surgery with extensive margins, she was given a dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and adjuvant radiation therapy for 2.5 weeks.  Two weeks post radiation she developed nodules in the same region and testing indicated they were malignant melanoma with high KIT expression. She enrolled in a clinical trial with a dose of 400mg imatinib per day (Nov 2006). Less than 4 weeks later, all nodules had disappeared. Upon a lowered dosage to 200mg of imatinib, the nodules returned and subsequently the dosage was increased to 600mg/day. The patient remained melanoma-free on 600mg imatinib until a follow up in Jan 2008. The authors do not provide further details on patient outcome.",

The targeted therapeutics nilotinib and sunitinib have shown efficacy in treating KIT overactive patients, and are in late-stage trials in melanoma and GIST. KIT overactivity can be the result of many genomic events from genomic amplification to overexpression to missense mutations. Missense mutations have been shown to be key players in mediating clinical response and acquired resistance in patients being treated with these targeted therapeutics.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

    "description": "In this in vitro study, the H1915 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (homozygous for a R351W mutation) was shown to be susceptible to imatinib. This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.",

Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

        "description": "IDH1 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.",

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

MDA-MB-231 is a basal-type breast cancer cell line which harbors KRAS G13D, and it had an ICD50 of 20uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and treated with pictilisib saw no reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated control. There was no effect on G1 arrest in pictilisib treated cells; however, phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced following pictilisib. Authors note that basal breast cancer cell lines were generally more resistant to pictilisib than luminal lines (p=0.02), and concluded that this cell line was resistant to pictilisib.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

        "description": "TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.",

        "description": "Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

    "description": "Several preclinical studies tested the effects of various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on Ba/F3 cell lines with representative primary sunitinib and imatinib sensitizing mutation del 557-558, which induced IL-3 independent growth, and secondary mutation A829P. The cells were tested for Sunitinib and Imatinib resistances. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 and A829P mutations did show resistance towards Sunitinib and Imatinib (Sunitinib IC50 for growth inhibition: 319 +- 88 nM and Imatinib IC50: 179 +- 27 nM) compared to Ba/F3 cells with the del 557-558 mutation (Sunitinib IC50: 7 +- 2 nM and Imatinib IC50:  27 +- 8 nM). Imatinib and Sunitinib were shown to not reduce p-KIT at all in Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/ A829P mutations.  Patient-derived GIST-T1/829 cells with 560-578 deletion/A829P mutations (Sunitinib IC50: 1168 nM and Imatinib IC50:1201 nM) did show resistance towards Sunitinib and Imatinib compared to GIST-T1 cells with 560-578 deletion alone (Sunitinib IC50: 15 nM and Imatinib IC50: 30 nM). Sunitinib and Imatinib did not inhibit p-KIT, p-ERK, and p-AKT in GIST-T1/829 cells.",

After 6-MP exposure, mass spectrometry revealed T303S cells possessed reduced concentrations of intracellular 6-MP metabolites (TIMP, TGMP, etc.) versus controls. T303S cells produce increased intracellular concentrations of hypoxanthine and IMP. Also, after 6-MP exposure, T303S cells display reduced levels of DNA damage response and apoptosis protein markers. The enhanced production of hypoxanthine likely leads to reduced conversion of thiopurines to their active form due to competitive inhibition.",

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop.

        "description": "RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistance. Highly selective and well-tolerated RET inhibitors, selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (BLU-667), have been FDA approved recently for the treatment of RET fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer and RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer.",

        "description": "TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.",

The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations.

Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.",

Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

HCC1954 and KPL-4 cell lines expressing PIK3CA H1047R were associated with similar sensitivity to T-DM1 as PIK3CA wild-type cell line SK-BR-3; reduced cell viability was observed at concentrations > 0.01 ug/mL in all three cell lines. Conversely, the cell lines harboring PIK3CA H1047R were resistant to trastuzumab in vitro at all concentrations tested (0-10 ug/mL). Further, treatment with T-DM1 on SCID mice xenografted with KPL-4 (PIK3CA H1047R cells) resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. A single dose of T-DM1 >5mg/kg was sufficient to induce tumor regression >20 days after administration.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Additionally, ATM phosphorylates p53, resulting in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and leading to senescence or apoptosis. Somatic variants can result in inhibition or loss of these functions and can cause resistance to therapies that rely on inducing apoptosis via DSBs.

PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

    "description": "Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, some of whom had prior therapy. The effect of the C2488Y variant on ATM expression was tested by western blot, and the effect on ATM function was tested by treating with doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and monitoring p21 induction. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. A patient sample had the C2488Y variant of ATM, confirmed by sanger sequencing, in trans with a loss of function 11q deletion found in 90% of cells by FISH. Western blot showed stable ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was much lower than the median expression level of treated controls which was 815% that of untreated controls, supporting resistance.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The study found that dactolisib was effective in inhibiting outgrowth of E545K mutant-containing cells. Dactolisib was also combined with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib with similar abrogation of growth for PIK3CA E545K expressing cells. Growth of untransduced BT-474 control cells was prevented by treatment with any monotherapy or combination of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or dactolisib.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

Using a western blot, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to have a 0.6-fold down-regulation (compared to the Control) for Procaspase-3 protein expression. In addition, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to be more resistant to methotrexate and doxorubicin. Reduced levels of drug-induced apoptosis were seen in Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells treated with doxorubicin (0.05 uM and 0.10 uM) and methotrexate (25 nM and 50 nM) in DNA fragmentation assays.

        "description": "TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.",

PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 cells (IC50 4.17ug/ml & 8.91ug/ml respectively).",

        "description": "The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.",

Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.",

Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).",

BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

        "description": "EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.",

In a cohort of 229 NSCLC patients that underwent molecular testing, one was found to have a BRAF G596C mutation. This mutation had low kinase activity and reduced MEK/ERK activation compared to wtBRAF in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Elevated MEK/ERK activation was seen when BRAF G596C was expressed in the presence of CRAF, and this activity was inhibited by both Dabrafenib and Trametinib. A lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) expressing BRAF G596C showed reduced ERK activation when treated with combination Dabrafenib and Trametinib. These results support the use of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in MAPK pathway inhibition in the context of kinase-impaired BRAF mutants such as G596C.",

        "description": "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MCF7 is a luminal type breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.34uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, MCF7 cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice treated with 100mg/kg pictilisib experienced a 62% tumor reduction, and those treated with 150mg/kg experienced a 70% tumor reduction, with respect to untreated control. Authors note that pictilisib was well tolerated and observed no toxicities or significant weight loss. Authors further note that luminal-like cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like (p=0.02).",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. 32/40 tumors harbored KRAS mutations including 4 G12C mutations where disease stabilization occurred in 3/4 treated with BEZ235 or doublet therapy and 2/4 treated with AZD6244 only.",

Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.",

The effect of the D1930V variant on ATM expression was tested by western blot, and the effect on ATM function was tested by treating with doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and monitoring p21 induction. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. A patient sample had the D1930V variant of ATM, confirmed by sanger sequencing, in trans with a loss of function 11q deletion found in 88% of cells by FISH. Western blot showed null ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in p21 expression greater than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was considered by the authors to be similar to treated wild-type controls with a median expression level 815% that of untreated controls suggesting this variant does not support resistance.",

Upon sensing double-stranded breaks (DSB), the wild-type kinase encoded by ATM initiates the DNA-damage response by phosphorylating histone H2AX and, subsequently, various other proteins, such as BRCA1 and the MRE11\u2013RAD50\u2013NBS1 (MRN) complex, which are recruited to the damaged site. Additionally, ATM phosphorylates p53, resulting in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and leading to senescence or apoptosis. Somatic variants can result in inhibition or loss of these functions and can cause resistance to therapies that rely on inducing apoptosis via DSBs. Germline variants in A-T patients result in a predisposition to cancer, most frequently hematologic or breast. PARP inhibition has been studied for its potential in treating ATM mutated breast cancer patients.",

Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.",

An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.",

V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.\n\nOncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors.\nClass 1 BRAF mutations (V600) are RAS-independent, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors.\nClass 2 BRAF mutations (K601E, K601N, K601T, L597Q, L597V, G469A, G469V, G469R, G464V, G464E, and fusions) are RAS-independent, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors.\nClass 3 BRAF mutations (D287H, V459L, G466V, G466E, G466A, S467L, G469E, N581S, N581I, D594N, D594G, D594A, D594H, F595L, G596D, and G596R) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase.",

The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.",

Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section).",

Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other\ntumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found.

        "description": "TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.",

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.
