.. note::

   This project will culminate in a production-ready pipeline that will produce the full set of
   ClinVar, CIViC and Molecular Oncology Almanac data. As these knowledge bases produce new releases
   we will be transforming them to the GA4GH GKS standards defined here and making them available
   for public download. More details on this final dataset availability will be posted here.
