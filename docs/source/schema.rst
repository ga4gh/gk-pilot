GKS Schemas
!!!!!!!!!!!

Implementation of the pilot project requires the coordinated use of multiple schemas supporting
genomic knowledge exchange.

VRS
@@@
To enable consistency and model inheritance, we have implemented a `VRS draft implementation`
that uses common data models and concepts shared with other genomic knowledge standards. In
the first iteration of this pilot, the GKS core models are housed in the VRS repository alongside
the VRS JSON Schema.

VRSATILE
@@@@@@@@
We have implemented a new draft of VRSATILE that includes the `categorical variation specification`_
and the `value object descriptor specification`_.
